# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with the Fibonacci numbers at position 0 and 1, the first 11
terms will be:

```text
index  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,  7,  8,  9, 10
number 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55
```

## Solve Even Fibonacci Numbers

Write a function `even_fibo_sum` that computes the sum of the even-valued terms
in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed the given `limit`.

## Function Signatue

```lua
function even_fibo_sum(limit: number): number
```

## Examples

```text
in: -1  out:  0
in:  0  out:  0
in:  2  out:  2
in: 10  out: 10
in: 60  out: 44
```
